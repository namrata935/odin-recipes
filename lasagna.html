                Making our easy veggie lasagna is quicker than you might think. First, make our homemade veggie sauce. Cook onions until soft in olive oil, then add garlic, red pepper flakes (for heat), and veggies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add crushed tomatoes and roasted red peppers, then simmer until the veggies are tender, and stir in fresh basil. We still want the vegetables to have a little crunch since they will continue to cook in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the cheesy layer, stir together the ricotta cheese, and a bit of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then get ready to assemble! I start with the vegetable sauce on the bottom and add noodles, ricotta, shredded cheese, and another layer of noodles. Repeat this to have 3 layers of noodles, and finish with sauce and extra shredded cheese on top. If you wanted a slightly different spin on this recipe, try our veggie lasagna roll-ups, which use the same lasagna filling.

                When baking veggie lasagna, I cover it with foil for the first 20 minutes, then uncover and bake until the cheese on top is melty and golden brown. It bakes for about 35 minutes in total. Before serving, make sure you leave it to cool for 10 to 15 minutes so that the middle firms up a bit.
