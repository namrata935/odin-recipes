    <p>Noodles for breakfast? You may think it’s crazy. But, it’s actually a traditional South Indian breakfast item! Although, I don’t mean hakka noodles in soy sauce…</p>
    <p>Shavige Uppittu / Sevai consists of rice vermicelli noodles mixed with a basic South Indian style tempering and lemon. It’s such a simple, yet delicious dish. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vermicelli is, of course, one of the most important components of the dish.</li>
        <li>Oil is needed for tempering the lentils, nuts, and spices. Traditionally, you’ll want to use gingelly oil (raw sesame oil).</li>
        <li>Black mustard seeds are spicy, hot, and peppery. Don’t substitute for white mustard.</li>
        <li>Chana dal is an essential part of South Indian tadka (tempering). It’s nutty and earthy, but also adds delicious crisp pieces to the recipe!</li>
        <li>Split urad dal provides explosions of mild, creamy, and nutty flavor in every bite.</li>
        <li>Curry leaves build on the citrusy flavors. Use fresh.</li>
            <li>Lemon</li>
           <li> Green chilis </li>
            <li>Turmeric powder in moderation gives a beautiful golden color and earthy, peppery nuance.</li>
            <li>Salt is a must. Season your food, always!</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander (cilantro, for U.S. readers) is the perfect finishing touch, with citrusy overtones</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the vermicelli and then put it to cook. </li>
        <li>Temper the lentils, curry leaves, nuts, green chilis, and turmeric in oil. </li>
        <li>Pour the tempering over the vermicelli.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice, salt, and freshly chopped coriander to the vermicelli. Mix well.</li>
    </ol>
